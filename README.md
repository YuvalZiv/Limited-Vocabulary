# Limited Vocabulary
This project is meant to enrich the English language.
The program will get 2 files, a text file and vocabulary file.
Using the vocabulary file, the program will replace the words in the text file.

## Getting Started
You can download the entire project, and you'll have a full C project, which you can run on VS.
Another option is to download the executable of this code from Limited Vocabulary\Debug\Limited Vocabulary.exe

### Prerequisites
If you download the full project, you need a C compiler.
I suggest using Visual Studio [Youtube Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuR-54fQrA0)
Otherwise, using the executable, you only need a way to run .exe files.

## Running the code
When running this code, you will need to enter to arguments
```
LimitedVoc.exe TextFile.txt VocabularyFile.txt
```
The first argument - ```TextFile.txt``` is the text that you want to alter.

The second argument - ```VocabularyFile.txt``` is the vocabulary file that the software will use in order to alter the text.


The altered file will be saved as ```TextFile - Rewritten by Yuval Ziv.txt```
